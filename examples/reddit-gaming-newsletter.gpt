Browse to https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/top/?t=week. Scroll the page two times to load more content.
Look at the post titles and determine which titles might make sense to include in a newsletter.
Consider at least 10 post titles before continuing.

A title can be considered newsworthy if it is about something that is happening in the gaming industry.
Do not include titles that are just personal stories from individual people.

Call the summarizer tool to get a summary of each newsworthy post. Do this for no more than 10 posts.
If the post is just a link to an article, give the link to the article instead of the Reddit post.
Write all of the summaries into a Markdown article. Make sure the link to the article is included with each summary.
